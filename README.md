🗡️ A Pokédex is a fictional electronic device in the Pokémon world designed to record and provide information about the various species of Pokémon that a trainer may encounter or capture. This iconic tool is used to assist trainers in identifying, learning about the characteristics and attributes of Pokémon, as well as keeping a record of the Pokémon they have encountered or caught during their journey. 🗡️
